This is an open source project to build an App to help diabetes patients in keeping track of their sugar levels and providing various alerts and diagnostic services.


Type 1 Diabetes patients need to monitor their sugar level several times a day. This is best done through a CGM sensor but its very expensive for most Indian patients. 


So most patients in India measure sugar level using a finger prick test, and note it down on a piece of paper. This paper often gets misplaced and the doctor never really gets to see the history of sugar levels of a patient. This causes serious hindrance in proper diagnosis and treatment.


Our App will help in maintaining a digital record of these sugar readings that a patient takes several times a day, as well as the dietary intake, physical activity, and insulin intake. This data will be easily accessible by the doctor chosen by the patient, and will help in significantly improving treatment procedures.


In essence:

1. Our App is a very simple digital record keeping device to begin with to help the doctors in proper diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes patients.


2. Once we have large enough data, we will apply various AI and ML algorithms to further assist the doctor in diagnosis.


3. This AI/ML analysis will also help in forecasting the sugar levels mainly to reduce cases of night time fatalities, which occur when the sugar level of a patient suddenly drops during sleep.

**Deployment:**

Please take a look at "Deployment File.pdf"

Also the "server.py" script and "Table Queries.pdf" will be needed for the setup.
